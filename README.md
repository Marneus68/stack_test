gtkmm Stack widget exeample
---------------------------

This is a little program that demonstrates the use of the [Stack](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/unstable/classGtk_1_1Stack.html) and [StackSwitcher](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/unstable/classGtk_1_1StackSwitcher.html) widgets from the [gtkmm 3 library](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/).  

The [great tutorials provided by the Gnome Developer Website](http://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/unstable/index.html) didn't include any form of help on how to use these widget so I decided to find out myself.   

This test program is inspired by the [Python Gtk3 Tutorial for the Stack Widget](http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout.html#id4).
